# Insurance-Benefit-Prediction-and-Data-Obfuscation

An insurance company called "Sure Tomorrow" wants to solve several problems with the help of *machine learning*. You are also asked to evaluate these possibilities.

- Task 1: Find clients that are similar to certain client criteria. This task will make it easier for companies to do marketing.
- Task 2: Predict whether a new client is likely to take out an insurance claim. Are the predictions of the model better than those of the *dummy* model?
- Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance claims that new clients may receive using a linear regression model.
- Task 4: Protect the client's private data without destroying the model from the previous task. It is very important to develop data transformation algorithms that can prevent misuse of clients' personal information if it falls into the wrong hands. This is called data hiding or obfuscating data. However, it is also necessary to pay attention to the data protection procedures so that the quality of the *machine* learning model does not decrease. Here, you don't need to choose the best model, just prove that your algorithm works accurately.
